excerpt: Upon entering The Middle East Downstairs on Sunday the 24th, I immediately
  noticed OCD’s Moosh and Twist standing among a group of people by the entrance.
  Recognizing them from their music videos and online presence, I approached them
  to introduce myself in person as the WTBU promoter they had spoken with on the phone.
  I expected a handshake, but instead received two big hugs. This is just one example
  of how downright cool these guys are, both on and off the stage.

Upon entering The Middle East Downstairs on Sunday the 24th, I immediately noticed OCD’s Moosh and Twist standing among a group of people by the entrance. Recognizing them from their music videos and online presence, I approached them to introduce myself in person as the WTBU promoter they had spoken with on the phone. I expected a handshake, but instead received two big hugs. This is just one example of how downright cool these guys are, both on and off the stage.
After saying my hellos I joined the crowd of concertgoers whom were dancing lightly, clearly waiting for something more. After a few opening acts to hype up the audience, and some chanting of “O-C-D,” Moosh and Twist burst onto the stage causing screams of excitement and an outbreak of enthusiastic dancing. Clearly, this is what everyone had been waiting for.
I was vaguely familiar with OCD’s music before this show, but after attending I can officially call myself a fan. Every song was catchy, unique, and a perfect blend of old-school hip-hop and new OCD-style originality. Moosh and Twist performed their set with an abundance of liveliness that never died down.
The two performers jumped across the stage, covering every inch of space, and constantly moving around with boundless energy. I guess that’s the consequence of being young, 20-year-old performers. Moosh and Twist clearly love what they do, boasting positive lyrics and big smiles on stage. OCD filled The Middle East with the same vibrant energy that flows throughout each of their songs.
Not only is OCD’s music instrumentally pleasing, but their lyrics poetically showcase their rap skills. Though unique, the voices of Moosh and Twist blend together perfectly in their music.
My personal favorite moment of OCD’s set was their performance of “This High,” a song that captures the exhilarating experience they have had performing on tour and living their dreams. During the song, Twist dove off stage into the crowd. Yet, instead of being carried by the audience, he jumped to the ground, dancing along with OCD’s fans.
Another great moment was OCD’s performance of “Kick Us Out,” which required overhead lights to go out and cell phones to be thrust in the air. The lyrics tell of OCD’s perseverance in this journey they’re taking with music. The song states, “We gon’ do it all, till they kick us out,” and that’s exactly what they’re going to do. OCD’s presence on stage is enough to prove that Moosh and Twist aren’t getting “kicked out” anytime soon.
The next day I had the privilege of interviewing Moosh and Twist here at Boston University. We discussed their rising success, their experience on tour, and got to know these two Philadelphians a little better.
