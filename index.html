There&#39;s no camping, audiences stand on nothing but brick, and there&#39;s only threestages -- two for big acts. And yet, the festival holds its own, consistently bringing inimpressively large artists for their lineups each season.

The band is touring their third album, “Down in Heaven,” with fellow Chicago natives, NE-HI and Jimmy Whispers. I sat down with Jack Dolan (bassist, vocalist, songwriter) and Clay Frankel (guitarist, vocalist, songwriter) before the show to discuss the creating and touring of their latest album, released on May 13.</p>

The quartet has a chemistry and musicianship that other bands cannot match. Rachael Price (lead vocals), Bridget Kearney (upright bass), Mike “McDuck” Olson (trumpet, guitar), and Mike Calabrese (drums), met at the New England Conservatory of Music and formed a band in 2004.</p>
